# PAIR PROGRAMMING 

    pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.

    Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves

   ## Why pair program?? 

### Greater efficiency <br>
    It is a common misconception that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient.when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making. 

### Engaged collaboration <br>
When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.


### If one programmer is more experienced in a certain skill, they can teach a student who is less familiar with that area. The less experienced developer benefits from the experienced developer’s knowledge and guidance,


# notes

    you can see some of the jQuery effects that show or hide elements and their content. can animate them fading in and
    out, or slide them up and down.


    show () Displays selected elements
    hide() Hides selected elements
    toggle () Toggles between showing and hiding selected elements 
    fadeln() Fades in selected elements making them opaque
    fadeout() Fades out selected elements making them transparent
    fadeTo() Changes opacity of selected elements
    fadeToggle (} Hides or shows selected elements by changing their
    opacity (the opposite of their current state) 
    delay() Delays execution of subsequent items in queue
    stop() Stops an animation if it is currently running
    animate() Creates custom animations

    The .animate() method allows you to create some of your own effects and animations by
    changing CSS properties.

    The CSS properties are written using camelCase notation, so the
    first word is all lowercase and each subsequent word starts
    with an uppercase character, e.g.: border-top-1 eft-radi us would
    become borderTopleftRadi

    DIMENSION/ POSITION 
    Get or update the dimensions or position of a box 
    jQuery has several important methods for working with dimensions:
    width()
    height()
    innerWidth()
    innerHeight()
    outerWidth()
    outerHeight()

    EFFECTS & ANIMATION 
    Add effects and animation to 
    animate() Runs a custom animation on the selected elements
    delay() Sets a delay for all queued functions on the selected elements
    fadeIn() Fades in the selected elements
    fadeOut() Fades out the selected elements
    fadeTo() Fades in/out the selected elements to a given opacity
    fadeToggle() Toggles between the fadeIn() and fadeOut() methods
    hide() Hides the selected elements
    queue() Shows the queued functions on the selected elements
    show() Shows the selected elements
    stop() Stops the currently running animation for the selected elements
    toggle() Toggles between the hide() and show() methods

    EVENTS
    An event represents the precise moment when something happens.
    Examples:
    moving a mouse over an element
    selecting a radio button
    clicking on an element
    click
    dblclick 
    mouseenter
    mouseleave
